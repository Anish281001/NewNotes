aws starts :-

ss -tunlp | grep 80 = we are finding port 80 from all the open tcp port.

for each instance there can be multiple network interfaces 

the public ip , security group ,etc all these things are created for network interfaces not for instances .

 ls ~/.aws/              

 ssh -i Downloads/web-dev-key.pem ubuntu@3.92.62.99

 54.83.64.177

 x` = yeh command se jo bhi script apan  instance bnate wakt advance details mein script 
  likhte hein vo sab instance ko computer mein run karke vo command pta lagaya jaa sakta hai.

ubuntu ke instance mein tomcat install karna easy hota hai.

route 53 kisi bhi instance ke ip ko ek name ke saath map karne mein kaam aata hai .



---linux commands for partion format and mount:

fdisk -l = this command is going to list all the disk .

fdisk /dev/xvdf = to open the fdisk utility for  xvdf hardisk. ( mainly iske andar jaane ke baad apan partition banate hai disk mein )

mkfs = these command  shows the type of formatting we can do with our disk . for this command to be run we have to hit tab 2 times not hit enter after typing the comamnd .

mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1 = to  format the xvdf1 partition  with ext4 format .

???????????? what is the meaning of mounting ? and mounting  karte samay file khali rehni chahiye kya .

here we  are taking the case of an toolplate website :-

cd /var/www/html
mkdir /tmp/img-bakups/
mv images/* /tmp/img-bakups/
ls images/   (iss samay images ke andar kuch bhi nhi rha hai kyunki sab img-bakups mein chala gaya hai .)

mount /dev/xvdf1 /var/www/html/images = this comamnd is for mounting but temporary . if you reeboot your system no mounting remains.

df -h = to checking the mounting .

for permanent mounting :-

vi /etc/fstab = we have to edit in this file some information as mentioned below:

/dev/xvdf1     /var/www/html/images     ext4 defaults  0 0 
0 and 0 is for dumping and file system check. 
?????what is the use of defaults here .
?????what is dumping and what is file system check .

mount -a = this command is used to mount all the files that you enter in fstab file .

mv  /tmp/img-bakups/* /var/www/html/images/

note(optional) :: agar yeh sab karne ke baad website k live server par images nahi dikh rahi hai toh iss path(vi /etc/selinux/config) mein jaakar 
SELINUX = disabled kardo. 

ssh -i wavecafe-prod-nvir.pem ubuntu@52.207.220.109
upaar wale command mein ubuntu ki jagah ec2-user use hoga when instance mein apan ne ubuntu linux ki jagah amazon-linux use kiya hai toh . 

????? security groups ke inbound rules abhi samajh nhi aaye .

agar launch template se koi instance naya banate hai toh vo saare instance separate users se nahi access kiye jaa sakte hai . vo ek hi end point se access kiye jaa sakte hai . aur vo endpoint hi request route karega alag alag instamce par . aur uss endpoint ko load balancer bolte hai . 

mount -fav = this command we have to run after mounting a file system using efs access points it means after editing in fstab file.


stress is a command which can stress your linux os on cpu and few other matrix .

???? what is the stress.

???? stress ke commmand samajh nhi aaya


 The CPU Utilization CloudWatch metric shows CPU usage per instance and not CPU usage per core.

we are going to host only static website on s3 bucket .

Ansible:--

ansible is configuration management tool also a powerful automation tool .

# for using ansible in linux we have to use ssh ,  in  windows we have to use winrm and we have to enable remote connection from windows powershell  and for different type of clouds it uses apis .

# you don't need to setup any agent in the destination.

# ansible -i inventory -m ping web01 =  kisi bhi dusre system se connection check karne k liye ping ka use karte h toh usko kane se pehle ek baar ansible  configuration file mein jaakar host_key_checking= false ko uncomment karna hai.

# ansible -m setup {hostname} = command to get information about the host.



terraform has speciality in cloud automation.

inventory file in ansible stores the host information and group information and information about variables .

default inventory  in ansible is  sudo ls /etc/ansible/hosts.

configuration tools are idempotent in nature . jaise ki yeh command { ansible -i inventory -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" web01 --become } agar jaise yeh command ek baar chalane ke baad vapas chalaya toh aisa nhi hai ki yeh vapas yum install httpd karega . kyunki web01 pehle se hi same state mein hai.

ansible-playbook -i inventory web_db.yaml --syntax-check = yeh command playbook ka syntax check karne k liye kaam aata hai. 

ansible -i inventory -m copy -a "src=index.html dest=/var/www/html/index.html" web01 --become = copying index.html from control machine to target machine . 

ansible-doc -l = command to get the list of all modules .

ansible-doc modulename = command to get the details about module.

ansible-playbook -i inventory web_db.yaml -C = yeh command playbook run karne k liye nahi hai. kyunki yaha last C bhi lga hua hai iska mtlb yeh hai ki yeh command ko dry run karke output btayega but yeh actually run nhi hua hai. aur yeh output close to original output hoga naa ki original output hoga .

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg = default configuration file :- shayad also called as a global configuration file.
                                                                         
system warnings = these warnings based on the configuration setting of ansible itself.

deprecation warnings = these warnings is for if you are using module , doing settings or writing playbook of older versions or using module which are depricated that means it is removed in further ansible upgrades so ansible will start giving deprecation warnings . 

ansible-playbook db.yaml -vv = two level of verbosity.
ansible-playbook db.yaml -vvv = three  level of verbosity.
ansible-playbook db.yaml -vvvv = four level of verbosity.

to print a variable or a mesage debug module is used.

ansible-playbook  -e USRNM=value1 -e COMM=value2 vars_precedence.yaml = command for passing variables through command line.

banner file is at  /etc/motd location . 

handlers file ke last mein lagte hai aur last mein hi execute hote hain.

ansible-galaxy init post-install =  command to init roles in role directory  . after this output on command line will be ( Role post-install was created successfully.).

ansible galaxy = it is a name of website which have predefined roles.

python:

rule for passing arguemments to a function:

func(params , args , default parameter , kwargs)

when we  define functions like func( name,age,  args,  i=2 ,   kwargs)

when we call functions like func('anish','twenty',   1,2,3,4,5,  num1=2,num2=1)  (default ko to call ke samay likhne ki jarrorat nhi hai)

all genertors are iterables but not all iterables are generators. like list is a iterable not generator.

devops real world projects 1:-


stack is used for the collection of services working together to create an experience 

nginx is a web sservice just like apache , httpd  is commonly used to create the load balancing experience.
as soon as request comes it will send to apache tomcat .

apche tomcat is java web application service . if your application is written in java so it is very famous service to host it.

if you require an external storage then you can use nfs service .

rabbitmq is a message broker and also said as queueing agent to connect two application together 

memcached is a very famous database caching service .

database vm mein agar password set karna ho toh /etc/profile mein jaakar set karna hoga like DATABASE_PASS='admin123' yeh likh do udhar . uske baad yeh command (source /etc/profile) lagana taki yeh variable permanent ho jaaye.

if we want to build an  maven application on jenkins which was taken by github repository and deploy it on tomcat server which was running on the local host of the computer . in this case why it is mandatory to install maven on the jenkins box it means our laptop or localhost on which our tomcat server and jenkins is running.
