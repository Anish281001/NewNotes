---------------------------/ command ends and vim editor also.----------------------


general commands :-

file devops.txt = this command shows which type of file is this . whether it is binaryfile or textfile it is .

ls -l = give the extra details of files or directory with list.

mkdir -p /opt/dev/ops/devops/test = creates whole path if they don't exists.

unlink cmds = it is used when we have to remove the link named as cmds .

ls -lt = showing files according to time when it is updated .

ls -ltr = reverse of upper command .
---------------------------------------------
command for changing the hostname 

vim /etc/hostname 
hostname centos66.devops.in
hostname 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

grep firewall anaconda.cfg = agar firewall word anaconda.cfg mein hoga to batayega.

grep -i firewall anaconda.cfg = agar firewall ,Firewall , fireWall ,etc koi bhi hoga to bta dega .

grep -i firewall * = poori directory ke andar agar yeh word ho toh bta dega . except any child directory in this directory.

grep -iR firewall * = poori directory ke andar agar yeh word ho toh bta dega . child directory mein hoga toh bhi btadega .

grep -vi firewall anaconda-ks.cfg = show all the lines of anaconda-ks.cfg except the lines which contain the firewall . 

less anaconda-ks.cfg = it is like a reader show the file contents as same as cat command but something different from cat command.it looks like a vim editor but it's not vim.

head anaconda-ks.cfg = it gives first 10 lines of the content of files.

head -20 anaconda-ks.cfg = show first 20lines of file.

head -2 anaconda-ks.cfg = show first 2 lines of file. (no. of lines are variable ).

tail anaconda-ks.cfg = it gives last 10 lines of the content of files.

tail -f anaconda-ks.cfg = it is also same as upper one but difference is it shows the contents dynamically mtlb jaise hi uss file mein change hoga to voh ussi samay uss file ke contents ko change kar dega . mtlb contents show ka live process hai to terminal par chalta rehta hai . and  q press karne par quit hota hai .

cut  d: f1 /etc/passwd = d is delimiter here : is delimiter it means when : comes next field starts , f1 means field no.1 it can be 2 , 3, etc. 

awk '{print $2}' file.txt  = jaisze kisi file mein jo content hai vo table ki form mein hai toh to iss command se apan uss table ka jo column dekhna chahe yeh vo column ko terminal par print   kar dega . yaha 2 mtlb second column hai .

useradd ansible = this command is used to add new user.

groupadd devops = this command is used to add new group. 

usermod -aG devops jenkins  = this command is used to add a user in the group . here user named as jenkins is  adding in the group named as devops .

userdel -r ansible = command to delete the user with home directory also. here username is ansible.

groupdel devops = this command is used to delete the groups .

-------------------------- file permissions 

***** niche 3 command samajh nhi aaya 

-rwx = read write execute for (root user)
r-x = read and execute for (root group)
r-x = read and execute for (others group)

ls -ld /opt/devopsdir = to find the permissions of particular directory.

chown  ansible:devops /opt/devopsdir = to change the ownership of a directory .

chown -R  ansible:devops /opt/devopsdir = same as upper command but differnce is that this command change ownership recursively it means it change the ownership of all   the subdirectories and file in the present directory also .

chmod o-x /opt/devopsdir = to change permission for other. here execute permission denied for others.

chmod o-r /opt/devopsdir = to change permission for other. here read permission denied for others.
 
chmod o-w /opt/devopsdir = to change permission for other. here write permission denied for others.

chmod g+w /opt/devopsdir = to add write permision for group.

permission are calculated by adding:

4(for read)
2(for write)
1(for execute)

chmod 640 myfile = read and write to user
                   only read for group
                   no permission for others

----------------------------------------
sudo :-

visudo = this command will open the sudoers file in the write mode .and iss command ko run karne ki permission bhi keval root user ko hi hai .

**sudoers file not have the write permission even for the root user also.

method1
** agar  apn koi user banate hai jaise ki ansible, usme yeh hota hai ki uss user mein sudo commmand chalane ki permission nahi hoti hai to iss ko solve karne ke liye    visudo ki help se sudoers file open karke vaha ansible ka naam add karna padega.  	

method2

[root@centos90 ~]# cd /etc/sudoers.d
[root@centos90 sudoers.d]# ls
vagrant
[root@centos90 sudoers.d]# cp vagrant devops
[root@centos90 sudoers.d]# ls
devops vagrant
[root@centos90 sudoers.d]# vim devops
[root@centos90 sudoers.d]# cat vagrant 
vagrant        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

[root@centos90 sudoers.d]# cat devops
%devops        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

now any user belong to group devops can rum the sudo commands.


------------------------------------------
 package management :- 

tree = this  command shows the directory in tree structure.

curl link = it is used to download the package . here link is the link of that package taken from browser which we want to download . yeh command root user mein chalate hai.

rpm -ivh packagename = this command is used to install the package . ivh meaning here is install and print human readable format .

httpd = it is a web server package .

yum automate the process of package installation and management .

yum manage all the work of curl and rpm itself. 

----------------------------------------
services:-


HTTPd is a software program, that usually runs in the background, as a process. It plays the role of server in a client-server model using HTTP and/or HTTPS network protocols. HTTPd waits for the incoming client requests and for each request it answers by replying with requested information.

systemctl status httpd

systemctl start httpd

systemctl enable httpd
 
systemctl is-active httpd

systemctl is-enabled httpd

--------------------------------------------

processes:-

top = show all the dynamic process based on the consumption of cpu and ram. it is similar to task manager in windows .

ps aux = show similar information as top command .

ps -ef = show the processes with parent process id .

ps -ef | grep httpd 

ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v 'grep'  = yeh vo saare process ko unki parent process id ke ssath show karega jinme httpd word hoga aur grep word nhi hoga.

kill processno. = kill parent process along with child process. first kill child process then kill parent process.

kill -9 processno. = kill parent process only  not child process.

orphan process = yeh vo saaare process hai jinke parent process kill ho chuke hai . after deleting their parent process these process are adopted by the systemd process.

best way to clear the zombie process is to reboot the system.
----------------------------------------------------

archiving :-

tar = 

-----------------------------------------------------
ubuntu specifc commands :-


adduser devops = this command is used to add the user .

to open the sudoers file in vim editor 
1)  export EDITOR= vim
2)  visudo

wget link = command is used to download a package .

dpkg -i packagename = used to install the package.

dpkg -l = to list all the debian packages.

dpkg -r tree = command to remove the package . here package is tree.

cd /etc/apt/sources.list = this file  contains the repository information.

apt update 

apt search tree

httpd in centos7 as same as apache2 in ubuntu18

apt upgrade = command to upgrade all the packages .

apt remove apache2 = to  remove the packages . here package is apache2 . but it will not remove the data and configuration of the service.

apt install apache2 = installing package apache2 .

apt purge apache2 = it completely remove the package with data and configuration also. here package is apache2.

----------------------------------------------
problem:-

vagrant user visudo command kyu nhi chala paa rha hai .

 agr jenkins sudo -i chala paa raha hai to su - ansible command kyu nahi chala paa raha hai.

vagrant user mein jab user add karna hota hai to command ke aage sudo lagane par hi command chalta hai baaki kyu nahi chalta hai.

sudo aur yum kab aur kaha kha use hota  hai
.
systemctl reload httpd aur systemctl restart httpd kaam nahi kar rahe hai 
.
-----------------------ps -ef command kya karta hai. = yeh parent-child relation ki tarah se process ko show karta hai .

tar
zip

------------------------what to use for installing the package dpkg or apt commands . kisi package ka installer agar already download hai to dpkg use karenge . nahi toh apt commands use kar sakte hai agar package scratch se download and install karna hai toh .
